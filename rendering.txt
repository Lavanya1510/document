Rendering: 
      Rendering is processing a code that we have written and showing the result of it.

Server side rendering:
      You extracted the HTML file/String from your Javascript/React code on the server and then sent 
a plain and simple html file/string to the client/browser that it’ll immediately show to the user without 
any extra step.

Client side rendering:
      You didn’t extracted the html string from javascript code on the server and sent the javascript file 
to the client/browser. Now, Browser can not show anything to the user immediately, Because now it’s the browser’s 
job to execute the javascript code, get the html string and then show it to the browser. This step can take fairly 
long time if your javascript file is big and you have a lot of components.
